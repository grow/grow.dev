## Treat images as content

- Treat images as content; avoid hard-coding images in templates.
- Refer to images as objects in front matter, using either `!g.static` (for images contained in the repository), or the path to the object in storage (i.e. Google Cloud Storage in conjunction with the [Google Dynamic Image Service extension](https://github.com/grow/grow-ext-google-cloud-images)).

Using these techniques has two primary benefits:

1. Defends against broken images as a build failure will occur if the image is missing.
1. Makes URL changes to the serving URL of your site safe, as the serving URL is dynamically generated by the `!g.static` tag or the `google-cloud-images` extension.

<section>
<div>

```yaml
image1: !g.static /source/images/foo1.png
image2: /bucket/path/images/foo2.png
```
<do>Do</do>
<label>
  Refer to images by their internal paths.
</label>
</div>

<div>

```yaml
image1: /assets/images/foo1.png
image2: /assets/images/foo2.png
```
<dont>Don't</dont>
<label>
  Images should not be referred to by their serving path.
</label>
</div>

</section>

### Avoid placing images in CSS

Images that are coupled to a piece of content or a partial instance (versus a
UI element) should not be implemented using `background-image` in CSS. Instead,
place the image in front matter to benefit from the advantages of treating
images as content. As a result, it's easier to maintain these images, and
localize them.

<figcaption>/views/partials/foo.html</figcaption>
```jinja
<div class="foo">
  <div class="foo__image" style="background-image: url({{partial.image.url}})">
  </div>
</div>
```

<figcaption>/content/partials/foo.yaml</figcaption>
```yaml
...
image: !g.static /source/images/default.png
image@fr_FR: !g.static /source/images/france.png
image@ja_JP: !g.static /source/images/japan.png
```

<figcaption>/source/sass/partials/_foo.sass</figcaption>
```sass
.foo__image
  background:
    repeat: no-repeat
    size: cover
  width: 300px
```

## Use the Google Dynamic Image Service extension

Use the [Google Dynamic Image Service extension](https://github.com/grow/grow-ext-google-cloud-images) for image management. Such a system provides many benefits:

- Support for client-side dynamic images. It can:
    - request WebP, JPG, or PNG images depending on browser capabilities,
    - serve images at different compression levels,
    - or resize images depending on breakpoint.
- Minimizes blob storage within the Git repository.

Small files (such as SVGs, icons, or otherwise) may be stored within the Git
repository. Projects with fixed sizes (i.e. a small project with just a few
images, that will not grow to be a larger project) can continue to store images
in Git. Once a project reaches a certain threshold (such as if it has dozens of
large images), or has certain performance requirements, images should be moved
to a CDN.

Alternatively, a CMS (such as Contentful or Kintaro) may provide its own
image-serving solution, which is acceptable to use as it keeps images out of
the Git repository.
